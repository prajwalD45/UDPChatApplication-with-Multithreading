# UDPChatApplication-with-Multithreading
"I created a UDP-based Chat Application with Multithreading. This project facilitates real-time messaging by leveraging UDP for rapid communication, while multithreading ensures seamless handling of concurrent client connections. Developed using Java for its robust networking capabilities and Swing for a user-friendly GUI, the application enhanced my proficiency in network programming and multithreadingÂ techniques."
